# Fixed Responsive Nav

### Responsive, fixed and touch friendly one page navigation, using [Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com/), smooth animated scrolling & vanilla JavaScript. Similar to the solution we are using on [Adtile’s site](http://www.adtile.me/).

To see the source code, open up [fixed-responsive-nav.js](https://github.com/adtile/fixed-nav/blob/master/js/fixed-responsive-nav.js) located under the "js" folder. The file should be pretty well commented out to explain what’s happening on each line. If you have any questions or problems, [tweet to us](http://twitter.com/adtileHQ)! This project is built using progressive enhancement and tested to be working on Internet Explorer 6 and up.

You are free to use the JavaScript, styles and the icon fonts provided here in your own project. Commercial or non-commercial.



# Features

* Fixed positioned, always visible navigation bar
* Uses vanilla JavaScript, no jQuery required
* Smooth animated scrolling
* Removes 300ms tap delay
* Adds a mask over the content when navigation is open
* Auto highlights current location
* Uses a tiny custom font for icons (only two characters included)
* Closes the navigation when user tap's outside of it
* Tapping a link changes the URL, so you can still copy/paste it and link to different sections
* Built progressive enhancement in mind
* Allows external links

##External Links

To allow external links, add the attribute `data-external-link` to the anchor element and remove `data-scroll`.

```
<a href="not-an-id" data-external-link>external link</a>
<a href="#normal-link" data-scroll>normal link</a>
```

# Live example

* There’s a live example here, take a look: [http://www.adtile.me/fixed-nav/](http://www.adtile.me/fixed-nav/)
* Alternatively, you can also try the navigation [on our site](http://www.adtile.me/) which uses similar approach
